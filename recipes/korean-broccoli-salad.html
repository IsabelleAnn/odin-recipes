        <h2>Broccoli with a Korean Sweet Sour Dressing</h2>
        <p>When I was in Korea, broccoli wasn’t easy to find, so it wan’t a familiar vegetable in Korean cuisine. I only saw in specialty import shops in local markets and in the imported food section at large department stores. Probably it’s more widely available in Korea these days, but at that time it was a specialty item. But of course here in New York City I can find it anywhere, at a reasonable price</p>
        <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2 heads of broccoli (1½ pounds)</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons of olive oil</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons of kosher salt</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons of sugar</li>
            <li>2 garlic cloves, minced</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon of crushed hot pepper (optional)</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon of ground black pepper</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon of white or apple cider vinegar</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Directions:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Thoroughly wash the broccoli in cold water to remove any dirt from between the florets.</li>
            <li>Cut off the tough tip of the stem of each head of broccoli, then cut the heads lengthwise along the individual florets, toward the stem and about 4 inch long. Each piece will look like a little tree.</li>
            <li>Place the broccoli trees into a pot and add ¼ cup water. Bring to a boil with the lid closed for 10 minutes over medium high heat.</li>
            <li>Open the lid, drain, and let it cool down for a few minutes.</li>
            <li>Make a coating sauce by combining the olive oil, kosher salt, sugar, garlic, dried and crushed chili pepper, ground black pepper, and vinegar in a large mixing bowl.</li>
            <li>Add the broccoli to the coating sauce and mix it all together.</li>
            <li>Serve warm or cold as a side dish for barbecue or any type of meat dish, or as a snack.</li>
        </ol>
