            <h2>Wontons in Chili Oil, Sichuan style!!</h2>
            <p>As you had as an appetizer in Din Tai Fung or your favorite Chinese restaurant this recipe is better! Perfect for holiday parties to wow your guests! First, lightly toast Sichuan peppercorns in a dry pan over medium heat for 2 minutes or until
                you can smell the aroma. Transfer to a mortar and grind with a pestle as same texture as chili flakes, set aside. Sichuan peppercorn has a very different flavor than regular other peppercorns. It gives a numbing feeling to your tongue.</p>
            <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>1 1/2 tbsp Sichuan peppercorns</li>
                <li>1/2 cup avocado, vegetable, peanut or canola oil</li>
                <li>3 cloves garlic, finely chopped (approximately 1 tbsp)</li>
                <li>1 oz ginger, finely chopped (approximately 1 tbsp)</li>
                <li>1 green onions, finely chopped, separate white and green part</li>
                <li>3 tbsp Thai chili flakes, you can substitute to regular red chili flakes to tone down the spiciness</li>
                <li>1 tsp sugar</li>
                <li>1/2 tsp salt</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Directions:</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Lightly toast Sichuan peppercorns in a dry pan over medium heat for 2 minutes or until you can smell the aroma. Transfer to a mortar and grind with pestle as same texture as chili flakes, set aside.</li>
                <li>Heat oil in a small sauce pan over medium low heat.</li>
                <li>Meanwhile, combine garlic, ginger, white part of green onion, chili flakes, sugar, salt and Sichuan pepercorns in a heat proof bowl. Carefully pour hot oil over the ingredients. Aware that the oil will boil immediately. Stir and set a
                    side. You can keep this chili oil for 30 days on a pantry.</li>
                <li>Boil a pot of water to cook wontons. You can use store bought frozen or homemade fresh onesâ€¦ it all works for this recipe! Cook the wontons until fully cooked, about 5 minutes.</li>
                <li>Meanwhile, combine chili oil, black vinegar, soy sauce and sugar in a small mixing bowl.</li>
                <li>Remove cooked wontons from the boiling water with a strain spatular and place on a serving plate. When the wontons are still popping hot, pour the chili oil mixture right on top. Garnish with green part of green onion, cilantro and sesame
                    seeds. Serve immediately. Enjoy!</li>
