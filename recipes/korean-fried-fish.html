        <h2>Korean Style Fried Snapper with Seasoning Sauce</h2>
        <p>The fish there is so fresh and delicious that I couldn’t resist trying out this simple, tasty, traditional Korean recipe, domi-yangnyeom-gui. It’s fried fish, but what really makes it stand out is the seasoning sauce, where the a mix of savory soy sauce, nutty sesame oil and seeds, and fresh green onion nicely compliments the fish.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1½ pound black snapper (or red snapper), cleaned and salted</li>
            <li>1/3 cup cooking oil</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons flour</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons salt</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Seasoning Sauce</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>1/4 cup soy sauce</li>
            <li>3 green onions, chopped</li>
            <li>2 garlic cloves, minced</li>
            <li>1 green chili pepper, chopped</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon Korean hot pepper flakes (gochugaru)</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons sugar</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon roasted toasted sesame oil</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon roasted sesame seeds</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Directions:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Take the fish from the fridge and pat dry with a kitchen towel. Sprinkle the flour on both sides of the fish.</li>
            <li>Heat up a nonstick pan and add the cooking oil.</li>
            <li>Cook the fish until the bottom turns golden brown. It’ll take about 20 minutes over medium heat. Turn it over with a spatula and cook the other side for another 15-20 minutes until that side turns golden brown, too.</li>
            <li>Combine the seasoning sauce ingredients in a bowl.</li>
            <li>Transfer the fish to a plate and place the seasoning sauce over top of the fish.</li>
            <li>Serve with rice, kimchi, a soup or stew, and more side dishes if desired.</li>
        </ol>
